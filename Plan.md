# MedLama Implementation Plan

This document outlines a 15-day, phase-based plan to build the MedLama platform, inspired by enterprise engineering practices and rapid AI-driven development.

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Initialize repository and folder structure for backend (Python) and frontend (Next.js)
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment and Node.js workspace
- [ ] Add basic README, .gitignore, and requirements files
- [ ] Create Docker configuration for local development
- [ ] Set up MongoDB (local or Atlas)

## Phase 2: Core AI & Backend Services (Days 3-5)
- [ ] Implement FastAPI/Flask backend skeleton
- [ ] Integrate LangGraph for conversation state management
- [ ] Add endpoints for user authentication and conversation
- [ ] Connect to MongoDB for storing conversation history
- [ ] Integrate LLM (Gemini/OpenAI) for diagnostic reasoning
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend logic

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (Days 6-8)
- [ ] Scaffold Next.js + TypeScript frontend
- [ ] Implement authentication screens and chat UI
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API (REST/WebSocket)
- [ ] Add real-time updates for chat and notifications
- [ ] Style with modern, responsive design
- [ ] Write frontend unit tests (Jest)

## Phase 4: Real-time Features & Emergency Handling (Days 9-10)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket support for live chat and alerts
- [ ] Build emergency detection microservice
- [ ] Integrate notification/alert system (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Add escalation logic for urgent cases
- [ ] Write integration tests for real-time flows

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance (Days 11-12)
- [ ] Achieve >80% unit test coverage (backend & frontend)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests (Cypress)
- [ ] Perform security and privacy review

## Phase 6: Cloud/Deployment & Monitoring (Days 13-14)
- [ ] Containerize backend and frontend with Docker
- [ ] Prepare Kubernetes manifests for deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and tests
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (e.g., GCP, AWS, or Azure)
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting (basic dashboards)

## Phase 7: Documentation & Final Review (Day 15)
- [ ] Update README and API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams and deployment instructions
- [ ] Document engineering decisions and patterns
- [ ] Conduct UI/UX and code quality review
- [ ] Final polish and project handoff

## Development Approach
- Daily check-ins and progress tracking
- Test-driven development for critical components
- Focus on modular, scalable, and secure design
