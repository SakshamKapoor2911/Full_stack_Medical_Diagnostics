## üåü Core Concept

MedLama is a cloud-native, microservices-based platform for preliminary medical diagnostics. It combines:
- A high-performance Go backend for API gateway, message queue, and infrastructure
- A Python AI/ML microservice using LangGraph, Gemini, and Perplexity APIs for advanced medical reasoning
- A modern Next.js frontend for seamless user experience

This architecture enables independent team development, robust scalability, and clear separation of concerns. The system is designed for reliability, extensibility, and real-world healthcare impact.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Folder Layout

The project is organized as three main microservices, each in its own directory for clear separation of concerns and team independence:

```
Full_stack_Medical_Diagnostics/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-service/      # Go backend: API gateway, message queue, auth, DB ops
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-service/           # Python AI/ML: LangGraph agents, LLM integration, research
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/             # Next.js frontend: UI, user flows, API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/               # Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                  # Utility scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**Benefits of this layout:**
- Enables Go, Python, and Frontend teams to work independently and in parallel
- Makes it easy to isolate, debug, and deploy each service separately
- Supports scalable, modular development and clear code ownership
- Simplifies onboarding for new contributors by clarifying service boundaries
- Facilitates containerization and cloud-native deployment
